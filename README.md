# dl_mnist_project

Hi, this is my deep learning project.

I created a folder and set up a Python virtual environment, installing TensorFlow, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

Next, I created mnist_keras.py, which builds a Convolutional Neural Network for the MNIST dataset. 
It loads the images, preprocesses them, trains the model for 5 epochs, evaluates the results, and saves the model and plots.

I ran the script with:
python mnist_keras.py

The program produced:
- mnist_keras_model.keras
- training_accuracy.png
- example_digit.png

Finally, I uploaded all project files to GitHub.
